# DotNetVideosCore
Free website aggregating videos about .NET related development topics, Angular + ASP.NET Core + MongoDB

The project will be developed within the framework of the competition [Daj się poznać/GetNoticed 2017](http://dajsiepoznac.pl) (Polish only, sorry).

The main objective of the project, and the reason of participation in the competition is purely educational, so the project is created with the idea to get to know the latest technologies available in the area of Web Development with .NET and JavaScript.

And so, the planned frameworks for now, assume:
- Angular 4
- ASP.NET Core
    - [JavaScript Services](https://github.com/aspnet/JavaScriptServices)
- MongoDB

A similar project for the previous year edition of the same competition was developed entirely using JavaScript frameworks (so NodeJS on the server side), but finally was not finished, due to lack of time and continuous problems with packages versions upgrades (sic!).

Hopefully .NET Core will be more stable and convenient framework to work with.
